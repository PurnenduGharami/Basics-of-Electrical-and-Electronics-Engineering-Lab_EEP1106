### **Part 2: 25 Viva Questions (Experiment 6)**

**Q:** What is a P-N Junction Diode?
**A:** A two-terminal electronic component formed by joining P-type and N-type semiconductors that allows current to flow primarily in one direction.

**Q:** What is "Doping"?
**A:** The process of adding impurities to a pure semiconductor to increase its conductivity.

**Q:** What are Majority Carriers in N-type material?
**A:** Electrons.

**Q:** What are Majority Carriers in P-type material?
**A:** Holes.

**Q:** Define Depletion Region.
**A:** A region near the junction where mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) are depleted (absent), leaving behind immobile ions.

**Q:** What is the "Knee Voltage" or "Cut-in Voltage"?
**A:** The minimum forward voltage required to overcome the potential barrier and start significant current conduction.

**Q:** What is the typical Knee Voltage for Silicon and Germanium?
**A:** Si: ~0.7V, Ge: ~0.3V.

**Q:** What is Forward Bias?
**A:** Connecting the positive terminal of the source to the Anode (P) and negative to the Cathode (N).

**Q:** What happens to the depletion width in Forward Bias?
**A:** It decreases (narrows), allowing current to flow.

**Q:** What is Reverse Bias?
**A:** Connecting the positive terminal to the Cathode (N) and negative to the Anode (P).

**Q:** What happens to the depletion width in Reverse Bias?
**A:** It increases (widens), blocking majority carrier flow.

**Q:** Why does a small current flow in Reverse Bias?
**A:** Due to **Minority Carriers** (thermally generated electrons in P-side and holes in N-side). This is called Leakage Current.

**Q:** What is "Reverse Saturation Current"?
**A:** The constant leakage current in reverse bias that essentially depends only on temperature, not applied voltage (until breakdown).

**Q:** What is Breakdown Voltage?
**A:** The reverse voltage at which the diode junction breaks down and conducts a large current (Zener or Avalanche effect).



**Q:** What is PIV?
**A:** Peak Inverse Voltage – the maximum reverse voltage a diode can withstand without damage.

**Q:** Why do we use a resistor in series with the diode?
**A:** To limit the forward current. Without it, once the diode turns ON, the current could become infinite (theoretically) and burn the diode.

**Q:** How do you identify the Cathode on a physical diode (like 1N4007)?
**A:** It is marked with a **silver/grey band**.



**Q:** What is the difference between Static and Dynamic resistance?
**A:** **Static (DC):** $V/I$ at a specific point. **Dynamic (AC):** $\Delta V / \Delta I$, the reciprocal of the slope of the V-I curve.

**Q:** Is a diode a linear or non-linear device?
**A:** Non-linear. It does not obey Ohm's Law ($V=IR$ is not a straight line).

**Q:** What is the effect of temperature on the diode?
**A:** As temperature increases, the reverse leakage current increases, and the knee voltage decreases slightly.

**Q:** Can you use an Ohmmeter to test a diode?
**A:** Yes. It should show low resistance in one direction (forward) and high resistance (OL) in the other (reverse).

**Q:** What is "Rectification"?
**A:** The process of converting AC to DC using the unidirectional property of a diode.

**Q:** What is an "Ideal Diode"?
**A:** A theoretical diode that acts as a perfect switch: 0 resistance when ON, infinite resistance when OFF, and 0 cut-in voltage.

**Q:** What is the range of the Ammeter used for Reverse Bias?
**A:** Micro-amperes ($\mu A$).

**Q:** What happens if you connect an LED in reverse bias?
**A:** It will not glow. If the reverse voltage exceeds its breakdown (usually low, ~5V), it might get damaged.
