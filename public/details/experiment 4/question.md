Here are the viva questions for Experiment 4 (Transformer OC/SC Tests) converted into your requested format.

### **Part 2: 25 Viva Questions (Experiment 4)**

**Q:** What is the main purpose of the OC (Open Circuit) test?
**A:** To determine the core (iron) losses and the no-load parameters ($R_0, X_0$).

**Q:** What is the main purpose of the SC (Short Circuit) test?
**A:** To determine the full-load copper losses and the equivalent impedance ($Z_{eq}$).

**Q:** Why is the OC test performed on the LV (Low Voltage) side?
**A:** Ideally, for safety and convenience. It is easier to generate the rated voltage (e.g., 230V) than the high voltage.

**Q:** Why is the SC test performed on the HV (High Voltage) side?
**A:** Because the rated current on the HV side is smaller, allowing the use of standard, lower-range ammeters.

**Q:** What does the Wattmeter read in the OC test?
**A:** It reads the constant **Iron Loss** (Hysteresis + Eddy Current).

**Q:** What does the Wattmeter read in the SC test?
**A:** It reads the **Full-load Copper Loss** ($I^2R$).

**Q:** Why are Iron losses called "Constant Losses"?
**A:** They depend on magnetic flux, which depends on voltage. Since transformers operate at constant voltage, these losses are constant.

**Q:** Why are Copper losses called "Variable Losses"?
**A:** They depend on the load current ($I^2$), which varies as the load on the transformer changes.

**Q:** How much voltage is applied during the SC test?
**A:** Only about **5% to 10%** of the rated voltage is needed to circulate full-load current.

**Q:** What precaution must be taken before starting the SC test?
**A:** Ensure the Variac (Auto-transformer) is at the **zero position** before switching on.

**Q:** Why is the iron loss negligible in the SC test?
**A:** Because the applied voltage is very low (5-10%), so the flux in the core is very small.

**Q:** Why is the copper loss negligible in the OC test?
**A:** Because the no-load current ($I_0$) is very small (2-5% of rated), so the $I_0^2R$ loss is tiny.

**Q:** What is a Variac?
**A:** A variable autotransformer used to adjust the AC voltage output continuously.

**Q:** What is the condition for maximum efficiency?
**A:** When **Iron Losses = Copper Losses** ($P_i = P_{cu}$).

**Q:** Define Voltage Regulation.
**A:** The change in secondary terminal voltage from no-load to full-load, expressed as a percentage. Ideally, it should be zero.

**Q:** What happens if you open the secondary of a current transformer (CT) while it's running?
**A:** It generates a dangerously high voltage across the secondary terminals, which can damage insulation and harm the operator.

**Q:** Does the transformer change frequency?
**A:** No, input frequency equals output frequency.

**Q:** What type of Wattmeter is used for the OC test?
**A:** **Low Power Factor (LPF) Wattmeter**, because the no-load power factor is very low (< 0.2).

**Q:** What is the unit of transformer rating?
**A:** **kVA** (Kilo-Volt-Ampere), not kW, because losses depend on Voltage (Iron) and Current (Copper), independent of power factor.

**Q:** Can you perform the SC test on the LV side?
**A:** Yes, but it requires a very high current supply and high-range ammeters, which is impractical.

**Q:** What are the two components of No-Load current?
**A:** Magnetizing component ($I_m$) and Core-loss component ($I_w$).

**Q:** Why is the transformer core laminated?
**A:** To reduce **Eddy Current losses** by breaking the path of circulating currents.

**Q:** What material is the core made of?
**A:** **Silicon Steel** (CRGO - Cold Rolled Grain Oriented) to reduce Hysteresis loss.

**Q:** If you apply DC to a transformer, what happens?
**A:** The primary winding will likely burn out because there is no back EMF ($d\phi/dt = 0$) to limit the current; only resistance limits it.

**Q:** Why is efficiency of a transformer high (95-99%)?
**A:** Because it has no moving parts, so there are no mechanical friction or windage losses.
