### **Part 2: 25 Viva Questions (Experiment 8)**

**Q:** What is a Logic Gate?
**A:** A digital circuit that performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.

**Q:** What are the three Basic Logic Gates?
**A:** AND, OR, NOT.

**Q:** What is the IC number for the AND gate?
**A:** 7408.

**Q:** What is the IC number for the OR gate?
**A:** 7432.

**Q:** What is the IC number for the NOT gate?
**A:** 7404.



**Q:** Why is Pin 14 and Pin 7 important?
**A:** Pin 14 is for Vcc (+5V) and Pin 7 is for Ground. Without connecting power here, the IC will not function.

**Q:** What voltage range is Logic 1 in TTL?
**A:** 2.0V to 5.0V.

**Q:** What voltage range is Logic 0 in TTL?
**A:** 0V to 0.8V.

**Q:** How many gates are there in a 7408 IC?
**A:** Four (Quad 2-input AND).

**Q:** How many gates are there in a 7404 IC?
**A:** Six (Hex Inverter).

**Q:** Draw the symbol for an AND gate.
**A:** It acts like a "D" shape. Inputs enter the straight back, and the output leaves the curved front.

**Q:** Draw the symbol for an OR gate.
**A:** It looks like a curved shield or arrowhead. The input side is curved inward, and the output side is pointed.

**Q:** Draw the symbol for a NOT gate.
**A:** It is a triangle pointing to the right with a small circle (bubble) at the tip.

**Q:** What is the Boolean expression for AND?
**A:** $Y = A \cdot B$

**Q:** What is the Boolean expression for OR?
**A:** $Y = A + B$

**Q:** What is the Boolean expression for NOT?
**A:** $Y = \bar{A}$ (A bar).

**Q:** If inputs are 1 and 0, what is the output of an AND gate?
**A:** 0 (Low).

**Q:** If inputs are 1 and 0, what is the output of an OR gate?
**A:** 1 (High).

**Q:** What is the output of a NOT gate if input is 0?
**A:** 1 (High).

**Q:** Why is the NOT gate called an Inverter?
**A:** Because it inverts the logic state (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).

**Q:** Can an AND gate have more than 2 inputs?
**A:** Yes, 3-input (e.g., 7411) and 4-input AND gates exist. All inputs must be high for the output to be high.

**Q:** What is a "Truth Table"?
**A:** A table showing all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs.

**Q:** What happens if you leave an input "floating" (unconnected) in TTL?
**A:** It acts as a Logic High (1), but it is susceptible to noise. It is considered bad practice.

**Q:** What is "Fan-out"?
**A:** The number of gate inputs that a single logic gate output can drive effectively.

**Q:** What does TTL stand for?
**A:** Transistor-Transistor Logic.
