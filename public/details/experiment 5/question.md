### **Part 2: 25 Viva Questions (Experiment 5)**

**Q:** What is the stationary part of a DC machine called?
**A:** **Stator** (includes Yoke, Poles, Field Winding).

**Q:** What is the rotating part of a DC machine called?
**A:** **Armature**.

**Q:** What is the function of the Commutator?
**A:** It acts as a **mechanical rectifier**, converting AC (internal) to DC (external) in generators, and ensures unidirectional torque in motors.

**Q:** Why is the armature core laminated?
**A:** To reduce **Eddy Current** losses.

**Q:** What material is used for the Yoke?
**A:** **Cast Iron** (for small machines) or **Cast Steel** (for large machines).

**Q:** Why are brushes made of Carbon?
**A:** Carbon is a good conductor, **self-lubricating** (reduces friction on the commutator), and softer than copper (prevents damage to commutator segments).

**Q:** What is the difference between Lap and Wave winding?
**A:**
* **Lap:** Parallel paths ($A$) = Number of Poles ($P$). Used for High Current, Low Voltage.
* **Wave:** Parallel paths ($A$) = 2. Used for High Voltage, Low Current.



**Q:** Does an Induction Motor have a Commutator?
**A:** No.

**Q:** How does an Induction Motor rotate?
**A:** The stator produces a **Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF)** which induces current in the rotor. The interaction between the RMF and the induced rotor current produces torque.

**Q:** What is a "Squirrel Cage" rotor?
**A:** A rotor made of copper/aluminum bars shorted by end rings, looking like a hamster cage. It has no windings.

**Q:** What is the advantage of a Slip Ring Induction Motor?
**A:** It allows external resistance to be added to the rotor circuit, providing **High Starting Torque**.

**Q:** What are Slip Rings made of?
**A:** Phosphor Bronze or Hard-drawn Copper.

**Q:** Why is the air gap between stator and rotor kept small in Induction Motors?
**A:** To reduce the magnetizing current required and improve the power factor.

**Q:** Can a transformer rotate?
**A:** No, it is a static device. An induction motor can be viewed as a "Rotating Transformer".

**Q:** What is the purpose of the Fan inside the motor?
**A:** To circulate air for cooling the windings (Heat dissipation).

**Q:** Identify the Commutator in a cut-section model.
**A:** Look for the copper ring split into many small segments near the shaft end.

**Q:** Identify the Slip Rings.
**A:** Look for 3 continuous copper rings mounted on the shaft (only in Wound Rotor IM).

**Q:** What is "Cogging" in an Induction Motor?
**A:** Magnetic locking between stator and rotor teeth, preventing the motor from starting.

**Q:** Why are pole shoes curved?
**A:** To produce a uniform radial magnetic field in the air gap.

**Q:** What is the function of End Rings in a Cage rotor?
**A:** To permanently short-circuit the rotor bars, allowing current to circulate.

**Q:** Which motor is more robust: DC or Induction?
**A:** **Induction Motor** (specifically Squirrel Cage) because it has no brushes or commutator to wear out.

**Q:** What is the EMF equation of a DC generator?
**A:** $E = \frac{\phi Z N P}{60 A}$ Volts.

**Q:** What is Synchronous Speed ($N_s$)?
**A:** The speed at which the magnetic field rotates. Formula: $N_s = \frac{120f}{P}$

**Q:** What is Slip ($s$)?
**A:** The difference between synchronous speed and rotor speed. Formula: $s = \frac{N_s - N_r}{N_s}$

**Q:** Can a DC Series motor be started on no-load?
**A:** **No!** It will attain dangerously high speed and may destroy itself.
