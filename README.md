# Basics of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Lab (EEP1106)

**"Where Circuits Meet Code: A CSE Student's Take on EEE"**

   

## 📖 About The Project

This repository is **Part 2** of my Open Source Learning Journey (you can find Part 1 on C Programming [here](https://github.com/PurnenduGharami/Programming-Problem-Solving-CSCR1501)).

This repo contains my work for the **Basics of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Lab (EEP1106)** at **Sharda University** (First Year, B.Tech CSE).

### 💡 The "Why"

As a Computer Science student, studying hardware circuits can sometimes feel disconnected from code. I decided to change that. Instead of just writing practical files, I applied a **"CSE Tadka"** to the syllabus.

I used **"Vibe Coding"** (rapid prototyping with AI assistance) to convert standard electrical experiments into **interactive web simulations**.

This repository isn't just a lab manual; it's a bridge between Electrical Engineering concepts and Computer Science application.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 1\. 🖥️ Interactive Web Simulations

Why just draw a circuit when you can simulate it? I created a website hosted in this repo that simulates the practicals present in the syllabus.

  * **Visual Learning:** See how KCL/KVL works dynamically.
  * **Logic Gates:** Interactive truth table verifications.
  * *(Click the link in the sidebar/below to try the simulations)*

### 2\. 🤖 AI-Powered Viva Prep

I used AI to generate comprehensive **Viva Voce** questions for each experiment.

  * **Scenario-based questions:** "What happens if we swap the resistor here?"
  * **Error-finding:** Perfect for preparing for the actual lab exams.

### 3\. 📝 Transparent Learning Workflow

Following my [HOW\_I\_STUDY.md](https://github.com/PurnenduGharami/Basics-of-Electrical-and-Electronics-Engineering-Lab_EEP1106/blob/master/How-I-Learn.md) philosophy:

  * **Raw & Real:** Contains my original observations and calculations.
  * **AI-Refined:** Notes polished for clarity without losing the student perspective.

## 🚀 How to Run the Simulations

Since I built the simulations using web technologies, you can run them easily:

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PurnenduGharami/Basics-of-Electrical-and-Electronics-Engineering-Lab_EEP1106.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `Simulations-Website` folder.
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
4.  **Vibe check passed.** 😎

## 🎓 My Learning Philosophy

> "We are all born in debt. Some realize it, some don't. I realized that knowledge was once a privilege, but now it is accessible. My goal is to organize this knowledge and give it back."

This repository is my attempt to document my 4-year journey openly.

  * **For Juniors:** Use these notes and simulations to visualize the concepts.
  * **For Peers:** Compare your readings, check the viva questions.
  * **For Recruiters:** This is how I apply code to solve problems in other domains.

-----

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

  * **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Canvas API for plotting graphs).
  * **Assistance:** Large Language Models (for generating Viva questions and refactoring simulation logic).
  * **Subject:** Electrical Engineering Principles.
