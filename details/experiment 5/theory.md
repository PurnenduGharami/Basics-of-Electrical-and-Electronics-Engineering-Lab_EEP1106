# Experiment 5: Study of Various Parts of DC and Induction Machines

## 1. Introduction

Electric machines convert electrical energy into mechanical energy (motors) or vice-versa (generators). This experiment involves studying the physical construction and internal parts of two major types of machines: DC Machines and AC Induction Machines. Understanding their construction is crucial to understanding their operation.

## 2. Objective

To study the constructional details and identify various parts of:

**DC Machine (Motor/Generator)**

**Induction Machine (Squirrel Cage/Slip Ring)**

## 3. DC Machine Construction

A DC machine consists of two main systems: the Stator (stationary part) and the Rotor (rotating part, called the Armature).

### A. Stator Parts (Stationary)

**Yoke (Frame):**

**Material:** Cast Iron (small machines) or Cast Steel (large machines).

**Function:** Provides mechanical protection and carries the magnetic flux produced by the poles.

**Poles and Pole Shoes:**

**Material:** Laminated Steel.

**Function:** The core carries the field winding. The pole shoe spreads out the flux in the air gap and supports the field coils.

**Field Winding:**

**Material:** Copper wire.

**Function:** When energized, it produces the main magnetic flux.

### B. Rotor Parts (Rotating Armature)

**Armature Core:**

**Material:** Thin laminated silicon steel sheets.

**Function:** Holds the armature winding and provides a low-reluctance path for flux. Laminations reduce Eddy Current losses.

**Armature Winding:**

**Material:** Copper.

**Function:** The working winding where EMF is induced (Generator) or torque is produced (Motor). Can be Lap or Wave wound.

**Commutator:**

**Material:** Hard-drawn Copper segments insulated by Mica.

**Function:** Acts as a Mechanical Rectifier. It converts AC generated in the armature to DC output (in generators) or ensures unidirectional torque (in motors).

**Brushes:**

**Material:** Carbon or Graphite.

**Function:** Collect current from the rotating commutator and pass it to the external circuit. Carbon is used because it is self-lubricating.

## 4. Induction Machine Construction

The 3-phase Induction Motor (IM) is the most widely used AC motor. It also has a Stator and a Rotor but operates on a different principle (Rotating Magnetic Field).

### A. Stator (Stationary)

**Stator Frame:** Outer covering (Cast Iron/Steel).

**Stator Core:** Laminated steel ring with slots on the inner periphery.

**Stator Winding:** 3-phase copper winding placed in slots. When supplied with 3-phase AC, it produces a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF).

### B. Rotor (Rotating)

There are two types of rotors:

**1. Squirrel Cage Rotor:**

**Construction:** Consists of copper or aluminum bars placed in slots and short-circuited at both ends by End Rings.

**Feature:** No winding, no slip rings, no brushes. Extremely rugged and maintenance-free.

**Use:** Fans, pumps, lathes (90% of industrial motors).

**2. Slip Ring (Wound) Rotor:**

**Construction:** Has a 3-phase winding similar to the stator. The ends are connected to 3 Slip Rings mounted on the shaft.

**Feature:** Allows external resistance to be added for high starting torque.

**Brushes:** Carbon brushes rest on slip rings to connect external resistors.

## 5. Comparison: DC vs. Induction Machine

| Feature | DC Machine | Induction Machine (Cage) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Supply | DC | AC (1-phase or 3-phase) |
| Commutator | Present (Essential) | Absent |
| Slip Rings | Absent | Absent (Present only in Wound Rotor) |
| Brushes | Present (on Commutator) | Absent (Present only in Wound Rotor) |
| Maintenance | High (Brush wear) | Very Low (Rugged) |
| Speed Control | Easy and wide range | Difficult (Frequency control needed) |

## 6. Result

The various parts of the DC machine (Yoke, Pole, Armature, Commutator) and Induction machine (Stator, Cage/Wound Rotor) were studied and identified.
